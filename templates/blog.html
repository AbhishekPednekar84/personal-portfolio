          <p>Code Disciples is a blog for all things code. The internet is vast and is full of great content and
                mostly
                awesome folks who are always willing to help. However, sometimes, we run into a real head-scratcher
                that
                requires rummaging through heaps of documentation or tutorials until we hit that "eureka!" moment. Most
                blogs on Code Disciples
                stem from such painful moments of frustration. The site provides a means for me to document topics or
                scenarios
                that I struggled with when I first encountered them or subjects that I simply felt would be fun to blog
                about. I hope you find at least some of them to be useful.</p>
